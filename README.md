### 2D Modelling Project

You are required to create a 2-Dimensional Greeting Card for the 15th anniversary of XJTLU, which should contain at least one key feature (e.g. a building on campus in a simplified shape) to represent the University.        Your Greeting Card could include balloons, flowers, trees, smiling faces, lights, sky and other objects that may appear in a physical greeting card.         It should consist of a background and both still and animated objects where appropriate.     Keyboard and mouse functions can be used to trigger the actions or display your Greeting Card in stages.    In particular, you should consider the following in completing this assignment:

• Proper configuration and use of the MS VC++ and OpenGL environments as for the lab work (i.e. an environment to use the freeglut library)

• Good visual effect of your Greeting Card utilising the full range of the techniques covered to date in the module (e.g. creation of geometry, transformations, viewing, animation and interactions via the mouse and keyboard)

• Effective use of relevant OpenGL libraries

• Good programming practice (e.g. necessary comments and neat format of coding).
